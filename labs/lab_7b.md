| Scenario                       | Jenkins Type         | Git Usage                  | SonarQube Usage       | Typical Org              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1. Basic CI                    | Single pipeline      | Main branch                | Simple analysis       | Small team               |
| 2. PR Validation               | Declarative pipeline | Feature branches           | PR decoration         | Mid-size team            |

**_1. Basic CI Pipeline (Main Branch Only)_**

**Purpose:** Continuous Integration on a single main branch.
**Stack:** Jenkins + Git (any provider) + SonarQube (local or cloud).

**Flow**

1. Developer commits/pushes to the main branch.
2. Git webhook triggers Jenkins.
3. Jenkins:
  - Pulls latest code.
  - Builds and runs tests.
  - Runs SonarQube analysis.
  - Waits for Quality Gate.
  - Publishes report or artifact.

**Typical use**

- Small teams or monolithic repositories.
- First CI/CD iteration.
- Ensures minimum code quality before merging.


**_2. Feature Branch / Pull Request Validation Pipeline**

Purpose: Validate code quality before merging into main.

Flow

Developer creates feature branch → opens Pull Request (PR).

Git provider webhook triggers Jenkins.

Jenkins runs:

Build + unit tests.

SonarQube scan with PR decoration (comments in PR).

Reports results to SonarQube and optionally GitHub/GitLab.

Typical use

Teams using GitFlow or feature-branch models.

Enforce code quality before merging PRs.

Faster feedback for developers.


3. Multi-Branch Pipeline (Automated per Branch)

Purpose: Automatically create pipelines for each branch.

Flow

Jenkins multibranch pipeline scans a Git repository.

Each branch automatically gets a pipeline.

SonarQube analysis runs per branch (SonarQube Developer Edition or higher required).

Benefits

Zero manual config per branch.

Isolated analysis per branch.

Seamless integration with Git-based workflows.

Typical use

Repositories with many feature branches.

Organizations wanting fully automated CI per branch.



4. Pipeline with Staged Quality Gates (CI + CD)

Purpose: Integrate code analysis into deployment pipelines.

Flow

Jenkins builds, tests, and analyzes code.

If quality gate passes → package artifact.

Deploy automatically to staging.

Optionally run integration tests before production.



Typical use

Continuous Delivery setups.

Projects enforcing quality gates as blockers before deployment.



5. Microservices Architecture (Shared Libraries)

Purpose: Standardize pipelines across multiple repositories (microservices).

Flow

Each repo contains a minimal Jenkinsfile.

Shared Jenkins library defines standardized stages:

build()

test()

sonarAnalyze()

deploy()



Typical use

Medium or large organizations.

10+ microservices using the same CI/CD rules.

Governance and consistency.



Parallel Branch/Module Analysis

Purpose: Large monorepos or modular systems.

Flow

Jenkins runs multiple SonarQube analyses in parallel (per module or component).

Aggregates results in SonarQube dashboard.


Typical use

Repos containing frontend + backend or multiple services.
